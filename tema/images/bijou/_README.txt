Hi there!

Thanks for downloading Bijou. It means a lot to me.
If you've got any questions, queries, icon suggestions, anything, I'd love to hear about it. Just email me (iam@visualidiot.com), and I'll get back to you when I can.

Bijou is licensed under the WTFPL, so there's no attribution required for anything. Go crazy.

Cheers,
@visualidiot
